    <h2>Crimes of Billy the Kid</h2>
    	<p>Billy the Kid’s first crime was theft of a Chinese laundry. He was thrown in jail by the sheriff who was just trying 
            to teach him a lesson however Billy the Kid escaped his cell through the chimney flue where he fled to southern 
            Arizona where he was known as “the Kid”. During his time there he got into much more trouble by stealing houses from 
            the U.S. Army however he had bigger issues with a local blacksmith. The Kid had decided enough was enough and shot Cahill. 
            He had left before seeing Cahill pass away and fled to Lincoln County. After getting to Lincoln’s County, he stole a 
            pair of Turnstall’s horses and ended up in jail. Instead of pressing charges Turnstall offered him a job on his ranch 
            as he was handy with a gun and those types of men were in high supply. </p>

	<p>Turnstall was later killed by a “tool of the house” reports Americanherritage.com which caused the start of the Lincoln 
        County War. Turnstall’s men including Billy created the Regulators to hunt down those who killed Turnstall. The regulators 
        ambushed Brandy, and Deputy Hindman as they walked down a street. The lawmen collapsed dead and riddled with bullets. Months 
        later the Lincoln County war ended with a showdown. House gunmen and soldiers from fort Stanton surrounded McSween, Billy, and 
        others in the regulator group. McSweeden was shot fleeing and was the only one who was caught. Billy was free however with 
        a murder charge it was momentarily. He talked to Wallace, the governor, and they struck a deal. Billy would get an out as long 
        as he would testify, Wallace later claimed the pardon came with another stipulation, for Billy to lead a different life. Billy 
        testified for the grand jury, however after weeks of waiting for the Governor to make good on his half of the deal nothing 
        had happened and Billy fled the town. </p>

	<p>He made a place near the Pecos River about 130 miles away from Lincoln County. At Fort Sumner he made a lot of Spanish speaking 
    friends. Despite being a gambler and thief those at Fort Sumner had a lot of positives to say for The Kid, or as they called him 
    Billito or el cs. The cattlemen on the other hand were unimpressed by Billy and his constant cattle rustling. Garrett became 
    Sheriff shortly after and after tracking down and capturing Billy and three of his gang he was put in jail and announced guilty 
    for the death of William Brady, being the only one charged for what happened in the Lincoln County War.The Kid was set to hang on 
    May 13th. While Garrett was out of town on April 18th he had surprised and killed two guards with their own guns. According to 
    history.com he ambushed a guard and shot him with the pistol the guard had, then getting a double-barreled shotgun and shot a guard
     who had been crossing the street. He then cut his shackles with a pickaxe and fled on a stolen horse. After fleeing they put a $500 
     bounty on the Kid's head. They had heard rumors saying Billy was back at the Fort as his sweetheart Paulina Maxwell was pregnant 
     with the Kid’s child. On July 14th, the sheriff slipped into town and went to Paulinas ranch. The sheriff shot two bullets at Billy 
     with only one making its mark right above Billy’s heart. It knocked him to the floor and killed him almost instantly. </p>
