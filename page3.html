    <h2>Theories and myths of Billy the Kid</h2>
    <h3>Myths</h3>
    <p>Billy the kid had been shot and killed on July 14th by Pat Garret. 
        He had claimed to end the lives of 21 men however most experts state 
        he has only been linked to the death of nine men. He is known to 
        have killed Windy Cahill, and two deputies after escaping jail with 
        the rest being in the Lincoln County War. The myth that he killed 21 
        people has been sensationalized by the press and is a story that is 
        passed down due to the obscurity of the claim. Billy the Kid has claimed 
        to kill 21 men, one for each year of his life. Those claims have been 
        debunked and he is linked to 9 murders in total.

<h3>Theories</h3>
<p>
	After Billy the kids death in 1881 some speculate he is was still alive, stating 
    Garrett had shot the wrong person on that fateful night. Two years after his death 
    at least two men emerged decades later claiming to be Billy. According to 
    history.com one man was John Miller. He was a farmer and horse trainer who lived on 
    the New Mexico Arizona border and passed in 1937. One reason believe he may have 
    been Billy is due to the pistol with 21 distinctive notches on the grip. The second 
    man was Ollie “Brushy Bill” Robert’s, e managed to get a meeting with the governor 
    of New Mexico in 1950 where he tried and failed to get a pardon for Billy’s murders 
    where he had passed shortly after. Details on Billy the Kid are hard to come by, 
    the most credible account of his story and life seem to come from his killer Garrett. 
    Garret in his book “The authentic Life of Billy the Kid, Noted Desperado of the Southwest, 
    Whose Deeds of Daring and Blood Made His Name a Terror in New Mexico, Arizona and 
    Northeastern Mexico” Garrett described how the killing of Billy the Kid happened. He also 
    goes into detail about what happened after his death. According to history.com “The next 
    day, according to Garrett, a Coroner’s Jury held an inquest, determined that the dead man 
    was Billy the Kid, and ruled that Garretts killing of him had been a justifiable homicide.” 
    Proving the theories and myths that Billy the Kid survived the shooting false. The state 
    tried to exhume the body and test it against his mothers DNA, according to history.com, 
    however they couldn’t find the burial plot due to a flood that washed away the markers in 
    1904. They had asked three of the pallbearers where his body was laced to rest however all 
    three gave separate answers to where he was buried making it almost impossible to correctly 
    unbury him without disrupting the graves of those around him.

<h3>Sensationalized</h3>
<p>
	After Billy the Kid died he has had 52 movies made about him and has stared in about 4 
    tv shows. These shows and movies don’t include the various documentaries about him. Some 
    noticeable actors that have stared in shows about him are Jack Beutel in “The Outlaw” and 
    Paul Newman in “The Left-handed Gun”. The first movie made on his life was, “The Adventure 
    of Billy the Kid” in 1911 and the most recent movie was “The Killing of Billy the Kid” in 2023.
